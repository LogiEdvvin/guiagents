  action_set:
    double_click: Double clicking with the mouse. Usually happens when the cursor
      is close to a clickable object on the screen that could explain the change of
      image. However, this form of clicking is rare when navigating the web and more
      common for opening files on an Operating System's GUI.
    drag_drop: Clicking, holding and then moving the mouse to a desired location and
      dropping. Usually happens when a "dragable" object is moving with the cursor
      or has moved to a different location. More common outside of web applications.
    hover: Keeping a cursor for several seconds above an object on the screen. Usually
      happens when a box shows up around the cursor with more context information.
    key_bindings: Special keyboard shortcuts that are not visible directly on the
      screen. Usually happens when something happens on the screen but is not explainable
      using the cursor.
    left_click: Left clicking with the mouse. Usually happens when the cursor is close
      to a clickable object on the screen that could explain the change of the image.
    right_click: Right clicking with the mouse. Usually happens when the a context
      menu opens up that gives you more options for the clickable object close to
      the cursor
    scroll: Spinning the scroll wheel on the mouse or arrow keys on the keyboard.
      Usually happens when the screen is panning/scrolling upwards or downwards
    select: Clicking and expanding a selection region. This usually happens when a
      coloured region in the shape of a rectangle or following text expands in way
      that it follows the cursor
    type: Typing text in a typable field. Usually happens when text begins trailing
      a caret (the vertical line that the cursor turns into when typing).
    wait: This means do nothing. If the screen seems to be loading the first page
      then most likely the only thing needed to do was to wait.
